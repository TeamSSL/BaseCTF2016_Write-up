Open pcap file with wireshark.
Use Wireshark Statistics>>>Protocol Hierarchy
We see that all the traffic are using http protocol.
Now we use Display Filter to find useful packets for the flag.
use “http contains basectf”
Then we found the interesting packet for the problem.
The frame number is 57.

After analysing the frame. We found that there is base64 encoded string which might be the flag in http Set-Cookie header.
Take a look. 

Set-Cookie : 3=QkNURntjb29raWVfaXNfd2Vha19lbmNyeXB0aW9ufQ%3D%3D

%3d is equal sign.
So, QkNURntjb29raWVfaXNfd2Vha19lbmNyeXB0aW9ufQ== is the base64 encoded version of the flag.

After decoding it,the flag is  
				BCTF{cookie_is_weak_encryption}
