Confusing Traffic	(Network 5)

In this pcap, we found some http traffic. So, we should check and filter.

http filter .
 
In this ctf, flag format is BCTF{}.
So let's filter “http contains “BCTF””.
Wireshark show 5 packets according to this filter.

Ok , let's analyse this 5 packet with tshark.

tshark -Y "http contains BCTF && frame.number == 4193 " -T pdml -r 100\(1\).pcap | grep "\{*\}"

tshark -Y "http contains BCTF && frame.number == 2910 " -T pdml -r 100\(1\).pcap | grep "\{*\}"

replace packet's number in frame.number …

Finally we found the flag in frame number 3112: BCTF{another_combination_to_get_flag}
