A cisco configuration file is given.
We need to find the enable secret password.
The secret password is Type 5. So, bruteforcing the password is too long.
We need to recover enable password from Type 7.
Type 7 password can be decrypt using online tool.

In the given file, we see four type 7 passwords.

username admin password 7 08740C4C0A0D0328130F010D24
username guest password 7 08740C4C0A0D0328151E09173E
username syst3m password 7 08740C4C0A0D032801121F107926
username user password 7 08740C4C0A0D032807180916

Decrypt the password using Cisco type 7 password decryptor.

Results are bctf_admin
			bctf_guest
			bctf_syst3m
			bctf_user

Now, see the pattern.
All the passwords start with bctf.

Now take a look at enable password. 

enable secret 5 $1$mERr$vPXNr8IoUKDWCPl9KDDFq1

5 is type 5 password.
1 indicates that the password is using md5 hash.
meRr is salt.
vPXNr8IoUKDWCPl9KDDFq1 is hash digest of the password using salt.

Hashing cannot be decrypted.
But we can find the password of plaintext by comparing the md5 hash.
Now we are using openssl command line tool to find the plaint text password.

root@kali:~# openssl passwd -1 -salt meRr "plaintext_password"

Take a look at the question.There is a hint.

After thinking a lot,i correctly guest the plainttext passowrd.

"bctf_secret"

bctf is obtained from cisco type 5 password.
secret is given from question.

Now,using openssl tool, we find the correct hash.

root@kali:~# openssl passwd -1 -salt meRr "bctf_secret"
vPXNr8IoUKDWCPl9KDDFq1

See.two hashes are the same.
Therefore, we can assume that the correct flage is found.

The flag is 
	BCTF{bctf_secret}
